# Welcome #

This is a repo for things to make setting up Klipper EZ for end users. This is where we will start collecting and adding Klipper configs for various printers we work with as well as information for other 3rd party scripts/mods/etc

# Config File Organization #

Every config file(s) must be in the following organization structure:


    BRAND > MODEL> CONFIG TYPE

Example would be if we have the stock config for a Creality Ender 3 V3 KE the folder structure would be:


    Creality > Ender 3 V3 KE > Stock

If we had a custom one that lets say Tim made it would be like  this:


    Creality > Ender 3 V3 KE > Tims Config
